I welcome any help from developers who want to contribute :)\r\n\r\nThere are two main parts of the plugin: Hooks and Integrations. Hooks are basically the WordPress defined action hooks for any specific event. This can be when a post is published or when a theme is activated. Integrations are the tools used to notify people of these events, like email or slack. Developers can add new Hooks and/or Integrations to the plugin to perform the tasks they need.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
