Get Notified is a simple to use notification plugin that notifies you of certain WordPress events.

== Description ==
Get Notified helps users know when certain events happen on their site. For now, the plugin simply sends a notification message to a Slack channel when a new post is published on your site.

I hope that others help contribute to this project to expand it and grow the number of integrations and WordPress events.
