Get Notified is a simple to use notification plugin that notifies you of certain WordPress events.

== Description ==
Get Notified helps users know when certain events happen on their site. For now, the plugin simply sends a notification via email or a message to a Slack channel when a post changes status (i.e. publish, pending, draft, trash) your site.

I hope that others help contribute to this project to expand it and grow the number of integrations and WordPress events.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `get-notified` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the Get Notified plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress
1. Configure the plugin by going to the `Get Notified` menu that appears in your admin menu
