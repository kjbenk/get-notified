Get Notified sends a slack notification when a post is published.

== Description ==
Get Notified helps users know when certain events happen on their site. For now, the plugin simply sends a notification message to a Slack channel when a new post is published on your site.

I hope that others help contribute to this project to expand it and grow the number of integrations and WordPress events.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `wordpress-seo` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the Yoast SEO plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress
1. Configure the plugin by going to the `SEO` menu that appears in your admin menu
