# Get Notified

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kjbenk/get-notified.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kjbenk/get-notified)

This is an open source project that I started to give developers the tools they need to create great notifications for a WordPress site. I welcome any help from developers who want to contribute :)

There are two main parts of the plugin: Hooks and Integrations. Hooks are basically the WordPress defined action hooks for any specific event. This can be when a post is published or when a theme is activated. Integrations are the tools used to notify people of these events, like email or slack. Developers can add new Hooks and/or Integrations to the plugin to perform the tasks they need.
